# Typepad

This is the demo application for my "Realtime Web Apps with Phoenix"
presentation.

1. Clone the repository
2. Install Elixir and Node.js
2. Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
3. Start the app with `mix phoenix.server`

Now you can visit `localhost:4000` from your browser to try out the application.
